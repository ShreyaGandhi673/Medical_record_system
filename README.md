Developed a CRUD web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a mock API for handling HTTP
 requests, enabling users to add, view, edit, and delete data entries.
Implemented an intuitive UI/UX design with features like inline editing, a floating ”Save” button, keyboard
 shortcuts for saving updates, and confirmation dialogs for delete actions to enhance user experience.
